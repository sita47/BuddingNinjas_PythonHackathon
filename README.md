                                                                    Python Hackathon

Hackathon gave deep understanding and oppurtunity practice on python/pandas, data visualization, data analysis. On project management  wise hackathon gave oppurtunity to learn about project flow in jira and GIT.

As a team we involved in creating GIThub. We created 4 branches as one for each person. one Development branch.
We decided to have one file for each of us during work phase. Once all the work is done we planned to get verified by others and merge the final code to one file.
We learnt to push our changes to our branch then create pull request to update in the develop branch. Then we fetch the updated file from the remote GIThub to local cloned directory.
We contined working this way throughout the hackathon.

For implementing in jira. Hackathon has 85 question to be completed and adition data analysis on hospital data.

We designed to have three Epics 
		Data Manipulation
		Data Visualization
		Data Analysis

Data Manipulation has all the questions related to data manipulation or retrieving the data.
Data Visualization has all the questions related to plots and charts.
Data Analysis will have all the adition analysis on data like statistical analysis..

Under each epic we considered questions as child issue and added 85 question under it.
Each question has be assigned to team members.
When we take question to work we mark the status as IN Progress.
When question is done we move it to IN Test and assign other team member to test.
When Team member verifies and says ok we move it to done.

We used pandas, matplotlib,seaborn to complete all the questions.

When all the questions were done we moved the epic to done.
We have successfully completed 85 questions.
